# Where

Where (*WAIR*, **W**hat **A**m **I** **R**unning) is a system information tool written in Java, and currently focused on Linux distributions. This code is based on [NoSequel's efetch](https://github.com/NoSequel/efetch/tree/main), ported to Java as effectively as possible.

## Compatability

Where has been tested and confirmed to work on Manjaro - however support theoretically exists for the following distros:

 - Arch Linux
 - Debian
 - FreeBSD
 - Gentoo
 - Ubuntu
 - Void Linux

I endeavour to add support for Windows and other Linux distros down the line.
